# TwitchDiscordBridge

Links the [Discord](https://discord.com) chat and the [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) chat together.

## Author and Licence

Hi I'm ollprogram, the author of this project. Thanks for using it. **Feel free to report any bugs or typo. I'll try to fix them. Since english isn't my main language, feel free to correct me if I made any mistake in this documentation.**

Find information about the licence used for this project [here](https://github.com/ollprogram/TwitchDiscordBridge/blob/main/LICENSE).

Familizarize yourself with the licence before using my project. It gives information about how you can use it.

## Description

With this application you will be able to link your Twitch chat with a Discord text channel in a guild.

When someone will send something on a specified channel on Discord, the same message will be send to a specified Twitch chat, and reversly.

In this project, I'm often refering to a "Bridge". But, what does a "Bridge" represent in this project?

> A "Bridge" is an object which transfers messages between two destinations. In our case destinations are Discord and Twitch.

## Dependencies

For this project I'm using three APIs :

- [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
- [Twitch4J (Java Twitch API)](https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j)
- [Emoji-Java (API to manipulate emojis codes)](https://github.com/vdurmont/emoji-java)

  You can see the Maven pom.xml [here](https://github.com/ollprogram/TwitchDiscordBridge/blob/main/pom.xml).

## Download

You can download the runnable jar file [here](https://github.com/ollprogram/TwitchDiscordBridge/releases).

## Setup

There are some procedures before launching the program :

1. You need a [Discord](https://discord.com) account and a Discord server (guild).
2. Register a new bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) (I recommend you to watch a tutorial on YouTube).  
   You should also turn it to private mode.
3. Add your bot on Discord with the [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) using your bot client ID. The Discord bot will need some permissions on your server. See the permissions needed in the screenshot below:

   ![Discord Permissions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39884051/148686617-3ca8d816-2a52-4724-a2d9-98dd1c962cb9.png)

   If you want to activate other permissions, you will have to think about consequences. For example, if you decide to activate mentions to all roles for the bot, then every person from Twitch will be able to mention all roles on Discord.

4. Create a new [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) account for your Twitch bot. Recommended to use OAuth2 and to make your bot a moderator on the Twitch channel where you stream.

---

When you launch the program for the first time, you need:

1. Your Discord bot token (grab it on the [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)).
2. Your Twitch bot token (grab it [here](https://twitchtokengenerator.com)).
3. A Twitch channel name (The channel where you stream).
4. A Discord channel ID. You need to activate first dev mode on Discord `advanced -> developer_mode -> on`. Right-click on the channel where you want your bot to listen to it, and copy the ID.

## Usage

### To launch the program with the console interface

`java -jar TwitchDiscordBridge-1.0-shaded.jar` (cmd or terminal)

### To list all commands

Type `help` or `<command> help` in the console. Or type `!help` on Discord.

### All commands on discord

- `!test` to see if the bot works.
- `!code` to get the source code.
- `!bridge <argument>`
- Arguments :
  - `target` this Discord channel is now linked to the Twitch chat.</li>
  - `open` open the bridge.
  - `close` close the bridge.
  - `info` get information about the bridge.
- `!prefix <new prefix>` to set a new prefix (also changes the nickname of your bot).
- `!prefix reset` to reset the prefix (reset also the nickname).

### All commands in the console

- `shutdown` shutdowns the app without exceptions.
- `shutdown now` shutdowns the app with exceptions.
- `say your message` send a message on both platforms.

  - `close` close the bridge.



## Devcontainer

To use the devcontainer, you need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), running the [devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

Once these dependencies are installed, you can open the project in a new container from VSCode, the project and all of its dependencies will be imported automatically. 

On container startup, Maven will clean, validate, compile and test the project.

## JavaDocs

### Next Upates

- Allow to lock the bridge on one side. (comming very soon)
